-hi 1 am interested in making life easy
People say loving you gives pain and is full of sacrifices. But I will rather go through pains and lots of sacrifices than not to love you, my sweetheart.”
“Yes, we are imperfect, but true love will make everything so perfect. There are few things in life that I care for beyond life, the first is love, and the other is you.”
“Thank you so much for staying, even if you had every reason to leave. Thank you so much for making it so easy when life gets so hard.”
“Look at the computer keyboard, U and I were placed side by side. That’s how the alphabet should be arranged because my undying love for you will never cease to exist as long as it’s you and me”
. “It’s hard to find someone who is willing to stay with you in every up and down of your life. I feel so blessed to have you in my life because I know no matter what happens your love for me never ends.”
